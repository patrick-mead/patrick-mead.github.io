Planning to purchase a house can be a difficult task. I have heard the common advice that if an expense is less than three years away, you should maintain a more defensive portfolio. Often the advice is to taper your exposure to volatility starting from around five years, to prevent the supposedly devastating consequences of not having sufficient assets to meet the looming liability.
I have never been convinced that this is the optimal strategy for, at least, the following two reasons:

1. It does not model the expense as a choice. Or at least, it does not allow the decision maker to deviate from their initial choice.
2. It does not consider correlations between equities and property.

There is no apparent reason to me that extending or contracting the date of purchase is unreasonable. From the user cost of housing perspective, owning and renting should be economically equivalent. This is obviously contrary to much popular personal finance advice, which states unequivocally that owning is far superior to renting. Sometimes even going as far as to say that "renting is paying someone else's mortgage".
